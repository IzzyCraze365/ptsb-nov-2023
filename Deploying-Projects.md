# Deploying Projects

## Github Pages

- Need to know the folder name location
- Root file name (main file) needs to be an index.js

Once you have a repository
- Go into settings
- Scroll down to Pages
- Select Branch for "Main"
- Next is file locations in "Root"

If you are successful, you will be given a URL that will take you to your Live URL page.


### Render
This is for Vite Projects

Sign up with Render using GitHub

- Create a Github repositiory
- Render.com
- https://dashboard.render.com/
- Go to new deployment and "Create a new Static Site"
- It will provide a link once your site is live

#### Note
If you sign up to Render with Github, it will automatically show your projects that are associated with your Github account.

Amit recomments using Render for React projects, especially Vite files.
