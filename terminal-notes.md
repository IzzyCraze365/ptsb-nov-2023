# Terminal Commands

- **mkdir (file name)**
    - Create new directory named (file name)
- **pwd**
    - Display the path to the current directory
- **cd (directory)**
    - Change to the listed directory
- **cd..** 
    - Go to parent directory (go back one level)
- **cd** 
    - Go to base directory (usually C Drive)
- **ls** 
    - List directory contents
- **code .**
    - This will have VS code open (since that is our coding)

If a file name has a space in it you need to wrap the directory name in "quotes"

When starting to type a "directory" you can hit 'tab' to complete the line. (if you type "D" it and hit tab multiple times it will switch to the different folders that begin with that letter.)
